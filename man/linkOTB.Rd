\usage{
linkOTB(
  bin_OTB = NULL,
  root_OTB = NULL,
  type_OTB = NULL,
  searchLocation = NULL,
  ver_select = FALSE,
  quiet = TRUE,
  returnPaths = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bin_OTB}{String. Path to where the OTB binaries are located.}

\item{root_OTB}{String. Full path to the OTB root folder containing the
installation. If provided, it is also used to resolve the environment
initialisation script on Windows.}

\item{type_OTB}{String. Optional installation type filter (e.g. OSGeo4W/QGIS).}

\item{searchLocation}{String. Hard drive letter (Windows) or mounting point
(Linux). Default for Windows is \code{C:/}, default for Linux is
\code{/usr/bin/}.}

\item{ver_select}{Logical or numeric. Default is \code{FALSE}. If there is
more than one OTB installation and \code{ver_select = TRUE}, the user can
interactively select the preferred OTB version. If \code{ver_select = FALSE},
the latest version is automatically selected. If numeric \code{> 0}, the
corresponding row index of the detected installations is selected.}

\item{quiet}{Logical. Switch for suppressing messages. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{returnPaths}{Logical. If set to \code{FALSE}, nothing is returned.
If \code{TRUE}, the selected OTB paths and detected versions are returned.}
}
\value{
A list with at least:
\itemize{
  \item \code{exist}: logical, whether a valid installation was found
  \item \code{pathOTB}: path to the selected OTB \code{bin} directory
  \item \code{otbCmd}: best-effort base command as detected
  \item \code{version}: data.frame of detected installations
  \item \code{otbRoot}: inferred OTB root directory (one level above \code{bin})
  \item \code{envScript}: best-effort path to \code{otbenv.profile} /
    \code{otbenv.bat} if found, otherwise \code{NA_character_}
}
}
\description{
Locate a valid \href{https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/}{Orfeo ToolBox} installation
and return the relevant paths and metadata.
}
\details{
The function searches for an OTB command line installation and selects one
version if multiple installations are found. Historically, \code{linkOTB()}
also prepared the current R session by adding OTB paths to the environment.

In the current implementation, \code{linkOTB()} is intended to be
\emph{non-invasive} on all platforms: it returns paths and metadata, including
the inferred OTB root directory and a best-effort path to the OTB environment
initialisation script (\code{otbenv.profile} on Linux, \code{otbenv.bat} on
Windows), but does not modify \code{PATH} or other environment variables.

It looks for the \code{otbcli.bat} file on Windows. If the file is found in a
\code{bin} folder it is assumed to be a valid OTB binary installation.
}
\note{
You may also set the path manually. Using an 'OSGeo4W64'
\url{https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/} installation it is typically
\code{C:/OSGeo4W64/bin/}.
