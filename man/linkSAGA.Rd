\usage{
linkSAGA(
  default_SAGA = NULL,
  searchLocation = "default",
  ver_select = FALSE,
  quiet = TRUE,
  returnPaths = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{default_SAGA}{Optional. Either `NULL` (default; triggers [findSAGA()]) or a
`data.frame`-like object describing installations (at least a first column with
bin directory paths; a second column may provide module paths on Unix).}

\item{searchLocation}{Character. Search root or hint passed to [findSAGA()].
Use `"default"` to search standard locations.}

\item{ver_select}{Logical or numeric. If numeric, select the indexed installation.
If `TRUE`, interactive selection. If `FALSE`, automatic selection.}

\item{quiet}{Logical. Suppress messages.}

\item{returnPaths}{Logical. If `TRUE`, return the selection list. If `FALSE`, only
perform environment setup (side effects).}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
\describe{
  \item{sagaPath}{Selected SAGA bin directory.}
  \item{sagaModPath}{Selected SAGA module directory (may be empty on Unix in this legacy logic).}
  \item{sagaCmd}{Full path to the `saga_cmd` executable.}
  \item{installed}{The detected installation table.}
  \item{exist}{Logical; `TRUE` if a valid installation was selected.}
}
}
\description{
Detects available SAGA GIS installations and configures the environment for
calling the SAGA command line interface (`saga_cmd` / `saga_cmd.exe`).
Optionally prepares variables commonly used by wrappers such as \pkg{RSAGA}.

The function relies on [findSAGA()] to discover installations (unless a
predefined installation table is provided via `default_SAGA`).
}
\details{
The selection strategy is:
\itemize{
  \item If exactly one installation is found, it is used.
  \item If multiple are found and `ver_select` is numeric, the indexed installation is used.
  \item If multiple are found and `ver_select = TRUE`, an interactive selection is requested.
  \item If multiple are found and `ver_select = FALSE`, the "latest" entry is chosen
        (currently: last row; improve later by a numeric version compare).
}

On Windows, SAGA uses different module folder conventions depending on version
(e.g., `tools/` vs `modules/`). This function tries to derive the correct module
directory based on the detected version.
