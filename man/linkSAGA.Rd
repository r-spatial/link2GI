\usage{
linkSAGA(default_SAGA = NULL, searchLocation = "default",
  ver_select = FALSE, quiet = TRUE, returnPaths = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{default_SAGA}{string contains path to \code{RSAGA} binaries}

\item{searchLocation}{drive letter to be searched, for Windows systems default
is \code{C:}, for Linux systems default is \code{/usr}.}

\item{ver_select}{boolean default is FALSE. If there is more than one 'SAGA GIS' installation and \code{ver_select} = TRUE the user can select interactively the preferred 'SAGA GIS' version}

\item{quiet}{boolean  switch for supressing console messages default is TRUE}

\item{returnPaths}{boolean if set to FALSE the pathes of the selected version are written 
to the PATH variable only, otherwise all paths and versions of the installed SAGA versions ae returned.#'@details If called without any parameter \code{linkSAGA()} it performs a full search over \code{C:}. If it finds one or more 'SAGA GIS' binaries it will take the first hit. You have to set \code{ver_select = TRUE} for an interactive selection of the preferred version. Additionally the selected SAGA pathes are added to the environment and the global variables \code{sagaPath}, \code{sagaModPath} and \code{sagaCmd} will be created.}
}
\value{
a list containing the selected \code{RSAGA} path variables \code{$sagaPath},\code{$sagaModPath},\code{$sagaCmd} and potentially other installations \code{$installed}
}
\description{
Finds the existing \href{http://www.saga-gis.org/}{SAGA GIS} installation(s), 
generates and sets the necessary path and system variables for a seamless use of the command 
line calls of the 'SAGA GIS' CLI API, setup valid system variables for calling a default 
\code{rsaga.env} and by this makes available the \code{RSAGA} wrapper functions.\cr
All existing installation(s) means that it looks for the \code{saga_cmd} or \code{saga_cmd.exe} 
executables. If the file is found it is assumed to be a valid 'SAGA GIS' installation.
}
\note{
The excellent 'SAGA GIS' wrapper \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RSAGA}{RSAGA} 
is in line for a major update however it covers currently (Feb 2018) only 'SAGA GIS' 
versions from 2.0.4 - 2.2.3. The fast evolution of 'SAGA GIS' makes it highly impracticable
to keep the wrapper adaptions in line. \code{RSAGA} will meet all linking needs perfectly if 
you use 'SAGA GIS' versions from 2.0.4 - 2.2.3.

\examples{
\dontrun{

# call if you do not have any idea if and where SAGA GIS is installed
# it will return a list with the selected and available SAGA installations
# it prepares the system for running the selected SAGA version via RSAGA or CLI
linkSAGA()

# typical OSGeo4W64 installation 
saga <- linkSAGA(c("C:/OSGeo4W64/apps/saga","C:/OSGeo4W64/apps/saga/modules"))
# overriding the default environment using RSAGA and assuming you have 3 SAGA installations
saga<-linkSAGA()
RSAGA::rsaga.env(path = saga$installed$binDir[3],modules = saga$installed$moduleDir[3])
