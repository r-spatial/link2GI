# Reproducible Project Structure

Reproducible projects in R require three things to be explicit and stable:

1. **Package state** (which packages and versions are used),
2. **Filesystem layout** (where data, outputs, configuration, and code live),
3. **Execution entry points** (which scripts define the workflow).

General-purpose tools such as `renv`, `usethis`, or `here` address parts of this problem.
Project-template packages like `tinyProject`, `prodigenr`, or `workflowr` provide predefined directory layouts and conventions.

`link2GI` addresses a more specific use case: projects that combine R with **external command-line geospatial software** (e.g. GDAL, OTB, GRASS, SAGA) and therefore depend on a **strict and reproducible directory and configuration structure** across operating systems.

# Shorthand Best-Practice Workflow (Spatial R Projects)

This section provides a **minimal, canonical workflow** for spatial R projects using `link2GI`.  
It is intended as a **quick entry point** before the more detailed explanations below.



## Project creation (once)

Run **outside** the project directory.

```r
library(link2GI)

initProj(
  root_folder    = "~/projects/my_spatial_project",
  standard_setup = "baseSpatial",
  init_git       = TRUE,
  init_renv      = TRUE
)
```

This creates:

* a fixed folder structure
* an RStudio project
* optional Git repository
* optional `renv` environment
* skeleton scripts and configuration files


## Project entry point (always)

After opening the project, **run exactly one setup script**:

```r
source("src/functions/000_setup.R")
```

This defines:

* all project paths (`dirs`)
* required libraries
* sourced helper functions

No other setup code is required.

---

### Canonical `000_setup.R`

A minimal and robust project setup script:

```r
library(link2GI)

root_folder <- normalizePath(getwd(), winslash = "/", mustWork = TRUE)

dirs <- setupProj(
  root_folder    = root_folder,
  folders        = c(
    "data/source",
    "data/results",
    "docs/figures",
    "tmp"
  ),
  code_subfolder = c("src", "src/functions", "src/configs"),
  libs           = c("terra", "sf", "dplyr", "link2GI"),
  fcts_folder    = file.path(root_folder, "src", "functions")
)

dirs
```

**Rules:**

* do **not** call `initProj()` here
* use **relative paths only**
* avoid side effects beyond folder creation and library loading

---

### Script pattern (processing stages)

Each analysis script starts with:

```r
source("src/functions/000_setup.R")
```

All file access uses the `dirs` object:

```r
x <- terra::rast(file.path(dirs$data, "source", "input.tif"))

terra::writeRaster(
  x,
  file.path(dirs$data, "results", "output.tif"),
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

No `setwd()`, no absolute paths, no path guessing.



### Optional configuration via YAML

Processing parameters are stored separately:

```
src/configs/processing.yml
```

```yaml
ndvi:
  red: 4
  nir: 8
```

Loaded explicitly:

```r
cfg <- yaml::read_yaml(file.path(dirs$configs, "processing.yml"))
```

### What *not* to do

* do not call `initProj()` inside an existing project
* do not duplicate folder-creation logic
* do not hard-code absolute paths
* do not mix setup code with analysis logic
* do not let templates control runtime behaviour


### Core principle

> `initProj()` creates a project **once**.
> `setupProj()` reconstructs its environment **every time**.

All advanced features described below build on this principle.






## Scope of `initProj()` in link2GI

`initProj()` is a **project creation function**, not a general runtime setup tool.

It is designed to be executed **once per project**, at creation time. Its responsibilities are limited to:

* creating a defined folder hierarchy,
* generating initial scripts and configuration files,
* optionally initializing `git` and `renv`,
* writing an RStudio project file,
* selecting a predefined structural setup (`base`, `baseSpatial`, `advancedSpatial`, or YAML-based).

After this step, the project exists as a **static on-disk structure**.

---

## Separation of responsibilities: `initProj()` vs `setupProj()`

A core design decision in `link2GI` is the strict separation between **project creation** and **project runtime setup**.

| Function      | Purpose                                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `initProj()`  | Create a new project on disk                             |
| `setupProj()` | Re-create the runtime environment of an existing project |

### `initProj()`

* must be run **outside** the project directory,
* creates folders, scripts, and configuration files,
* must **not** be called again inside an existing project.

Calling `initProj()` from inside a project directory will create **nested duplicate folder trees**. This behaviour is intentional given its role as a project generator.

### `setupProj()`

* is intended to be called **inside an existing project**,
* ensures required folders exist,
* loads libraries,
* sources project-specific functions,
* returns the `dirs` object.

All runtime scripts (e.g. `main-control.R`, processing scripts, Quarto documents) should rely on `setupProj()`—**never on `initProj()`**.

---

## Default setups and configuration-driven structure

`link2GI` ships with predefined structural setups stored in a YAML configuration file. These setups define:

* logical data subfolders (`dataFolder`),
* documentation folders (`docsFolder`),
* temporary folders (`tmpFolder`),
* code locations (`code_subfolder`),
* required libraries,
* optional `git` and `renv` initialisation.

Defaults can be inspected programmatically:

```r
setup_default()
setup_default()$baseSpatial
```

The defaults are **declarative**: they describe structure, not behaviour.

---

## Creating a project from the console

A minimal example using a predefined setup:

```r
root_folder <- tempdir()
dirs <- initProj(
  root_folder    = root_folder,
  standard_setup = "baseSpatial"
)
```

This creates the full directory structure, initial scripts, and configuration files.

---

## Customising a project at creation time

Defaults can be extended during project creation:

```r
dirs <- initProj(
  root_folder    = "~/projects/my_project",
  standard_setup = "baseSpatial",
  folders        = c("data/raw/provider1", "docs/quarto"),
  init_git       = TRUE,
  init_renv      = TRUE
)
```

This creates a project whose structure is the union of the selected default and the explicitly provided additions.

---

## Location tags (`loc_name`)

The optional `loc_name` argument introduces a second hierarchy level below `data/`, `docs/`, and `tmp/`.

This is intended for workflows where a **single project manages multiple spatial sites or regions**.
If this distinction is not required, `loc_name` should be left `NULL`.

---

## The role of `src/functions/000_setup.R`

Every `link2GI` project contains a single environment bootstrap script:

```
src/functions/000_setup.R
```

This script is a **contract**, not an example.

Its responsibilities are:

1. define the project root (typically `getwd()`),
2. define relative folder paths,
3. call `setupProj()` once,
4. return the resulting `dirs` object.

It must **not**:

* create projects,
* hardcode absolute paths,
* call `initProj()`.

A minimal, correct structure is:

```r
root_folder <- normalizePath(getwd(), winslash = "/", mustWork = TRUE)

dirs <- setupProj(
  root_folder    = root_folder,
  folders        = c("data/source", "data/results", "docs/figures", "tmp"),
  code_subfolder = c("src", "src/functions", "src/configs"),
  libs           = c("terra", "sf", "dplyr", "link2GI"),
  fcts_folder    = file.path(root_folder, "src", "functions")
)

dirs
```

---

## Template system and file generation

`initProj()` generates project files by applying `brew::brew()` to templates shipped with the package.

Templates are responsible **only for writing files**, not for managing runtime state.

Each project uses exactly one setup template (selected via `standard_setup`) to generate `000_setup.R`.

Maintaining multiple near-identical setup templates is discouraged. A recommended pattern is:

* one canonical setup template,
* multiple YAML presets describing different folder and library combinations.

---

## Common failure modes

### Nested project directories

If a structure like this appears:

```
project/
  data/
  src/
  project/
    data/
    src/
```

then `initProj()` was executed inside an existing project or with an incorrect `root_folder`.

This is expected behaviour for a project generator.

### `dirs` pointing to unexpected locations

If `dirs` contains absolute paths outside the project directory, verify that:

* `root_folder` is set to `getwd()` in `000_setup.R`,
* folder definitions are relative, not absolute.

---

## Minimal recommended lifecycle

1. **Once**: create the project

   ```r
   initProj("~/projects/example", standard_setup = "baseSpatial")
   ```

2. **Always**: inside the project

   ```r
   source("src/functions/000_setup.R")
   ```

This defines a complete and reproducible workflow boundary.

```
